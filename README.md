# ESP32_PCB
# A pcb using espressif ESP32-S3-DEV
This project involves making a devboard using the ESP32-s3 module by Espressif.
We know ESP are the go-to microcontrollers when we want speed and integrated Wifi Bluetooth in out projects.
# Features
Fully designed in KiCad
Features a USB-C USB 2.0 for convenience
ESP32 DevBoard features a design under 100*100mm, making it ideal for production houses.
Built in AdaFruit NeoPixel as an actuator
Built in Zero-PCB/protoboard with ~600 holes to make deployment after prorotype as easy as it can get!
# Main components used
Espressif ESP32-S3-Mini-N8
Adafruit Neopixel 5mm
Texas Instruments tlv758p
USB C
